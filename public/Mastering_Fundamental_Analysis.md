# Chapter 1: Introduction to Fundamental Analysis

## What Is Fundamental Analysis?
Fundamental analysis is the discipline of valuing a business based on its economics rather than its share price. It examines how a company creates cash for owners, the durability of that cash generation, and the relationship between intrinsic value and current market price. The end goal is not a precise number but a defensible value range that supports rational buy, hold, trim, or sell decisions with an explicit margin of safety.

Key elements:
- A clear mental model of the business and industry structure.
- Quality of earnings and the translation of accounting profit into cash.
- Assessment of management’s capital allocation.
- Conservative estimation of intrinsic value using multiple methods.
- Risk identification and portfolio sizing aligned to downside.

## Objectives of Fundamental Analysis
- Understand the business model and its unit economics.
- Assess durability of competitive advantage (moat) and industry structure.
- Evaluate financial health, earnings quality, and capital allocation.
- Estimate intrinsic value using multiple valuation methods.
- Decide with an explicit margin of safety and risk controls.

## Types of Fundamental Analysis
- Top‑down: Begin with macro trends and industry structures, then narrow to companies.
- Bottom‑up: Focus on company‑specific fundamentals and valuation irrespective of sector.
- Quantamental: Use quantitative screening to surface candidates, then apply qualitative judgment.

## Key Principles
- Buy businesses, not tickers; understand cash flow drivers.
- Focus on normalized economics across a full cycle, not a single quarter.
- Diversify by independent thesis, not by sector label.
- Triangulate intrinsic value using multiple methods; distrust false precision.
- Always require a margin of safety and avoid thesis creep.

# Chapter 2: Understanding Financial Statements

Financial statements translate business activity into numbers. Read them in context: accounting policies, footnotes, and management commentary often carry the most insight. Always reconcile narrative with numbers.

## Income Statement: Quality of Earnings
- Revenue recognition policy and consistency with cash collection.
- Gross margin stability as a proxy for competitive dynamics and pricing power.
- Operating leverage and scalability thresholds.
- Non‑recurring items, stock‑based compensation, and one‑offs.
- Reconcile GAAP vs. adjusted metrics; trust but verify.

Signals of strength:
- Stable or improving gross margins with steady competitive landscape.
- Operating expenses growing slower than gross profit at scale.
- Limited reliance on adjustments to show growth.

## Balance Sheet: Financial Strength
- Liquidity runway: cash balances, revolving credit, and unencumbered assets.
- Debt structure: maturity ladder, covenants, fixed vs. floating exposure.
- Working capital quality: receivables aging, inventory turns, and obsolescence.
- Intangibles and capitalized costs; impairment risk.
- Off‑balance sheet exposures and guarantees.

Healthy balance sheets show conservative leverage, robust liquidity, and assets that retain value under stress.

## Cash Flow Statement: True Economics
- CFO vs. net income: accruals and working capital swings.
- Maintenance vs. growth capex; treat buybacks and dividends as capital allocation.
- Owner earnings: CFO − maintenance capex ± normalized adjustments.
- Free cash flow conversion over a full cycle.

Checklist:
1) Is CFO persistently below net income and widening?  
2) Are payables stretching while receivables age?  
3) Is capex primarily maintenance or value‑creating growth?

# Chapter 3: Business Quality Framework

Use a structured scorecard to evaluate the economic engine and durability of the business. Weight categories by your circle of competence and by what truly drives value.

## Business Quality Scorecard (0–5 each; weight in parentheses)
- Market structure and TAM realism (15%): fragmentation, growth, regulation.
- Moat durability (20%): switching costs, network effects, cost advantages, IP.
- Unit economics (20%): contribution margin, payback period, LTV/CAC with churn realism.
- Operating model (10%): fixed/variable mix, operating leverage, scalability constraints.
- Cyclicality and pricing power (10%): ability to pass cost shocks, contract indexing.
- Management quality and culture (10%): incentives, candor, capital allocation record.
- Customer concentration and bargaining power (5%).
- Supplier concentration and input volatility (5%).
- Regulatory/geo/political exposure (5%).

Interpretation: Scores ≤ 2 flag areas requiring deeper diligence; the aggregate helps calibrate both valuation haircuts and position sizing.

## Unit Economics Mini‑Framework
- Define a unit: customer, order, store, cohort—choose what truly drives value.
- Compute contribution margin after fully loaded variable costs.
- Estimate payback period on acquisition spend (months).
- Compute LTV with conservative churn and margin assumptions.
- Require LTV/CAC > 3x and payback < 18 months for healthy growth models.

# Chapter 4: Earnings Quality and Forensics

High reported earnings with weak cash conversion or rising accruals are red flags. Triangulate multiple signals to assess persistence and manipulation risk.

Red flags:
- Accruals ratio = (Net income − CFO) / Total assets; sustained highs are risky.
- Day metrics: DSO, DPO, DIO—look for regime shifts versus peers.
- Revenue deferrals/accelerations; channel stuffing indicators.
- Capitalized costs (R&D, software, commissions) rising faster than revenue.
- Related‑party transactions and opaque segment reporting.

Practices:
- Compare KPIs to GAAP movements; inconsistencies merit scrutiny.
- Read auditor opinions, internal control disclosures, and changes in accounting policy.

# Chapter 5: Capital Allocation Framework

Management’s capital deployment explains long‑run shareholder outcomes. Judge actions by opportunity cost and impact on intrinsic value per share.

Levers:
- Reinvestment in organic projects that clear a risk‑adjusted hurdle rate.
- M&A discipline on price versus synergy realism; post‑deal scorecards.
- Buybacks only below intrinsic value and funded by surplus cash flows.
- Dividends sized sustainably through cycles.
- Balance sheet sized to resilience, not optimism.

Evaluate through the “per‑share value” lens: does each dollar increase long‑term owner earnings per share?

# Chapter 6: Valuation Frameworks

No single method is sufficient. Use multiple approaches and prefer ranges to points; penalize uncertainty with wider ranges and larger safety margins.

## Owner Earnings and DCF (Conservative)
- Owner earnings = CFO − maintenance capex ± normalized working capital.
- Forecast 5–10 years with decaying growth and widening uncertainty bands.
- Discount rate = risk‑free + business‑specific risk premium.
- Terminal value via conservative Gordon Growth or exit multiple sanity checks.

## Residual Income Model
- Intrinsic value = Book value + PV of future residual incomes.
- Residual income = Net income − (Cost of equity × Beginning book value).
- Useful where accounting earnings approximate economic earnings.

## Multiples Triangle
- Cross‑check EV/EBIT, EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/B where relevant to economics.
- Normalize margins and cyclicality; compare to through‑cycle peer medians.
- Use reverse DCF to infer market‑implied assumptions and test plausibility.

## Margin of Safety Policy
- Wide‑moat and resilient cash flows: ≥ 20% discount to mid‑point value.
- Average quality: ≥ 30–35% discount.
- Cyclical/uncertain: ≥ 50% discount or avoid.

# Chapter 7: Risk Assessment and Position Sizing

Risk is the probability and magnitude of permanent capital loss. Volatility is not risk. Size positions by thesis independence, downside, and portfolio context.

Checklist:
- Single‑point‑of‑failure suppliers or customers; key‑person reliance.
- Balance‑sheet stress test under a 2008‑style liquidity shock.
- Regulatory, technological, or competitive displacement scenarios.
- Position sizing rule of thumb: a single outlier should not cost > 2% of the portfolio in a realistic stress.

Position sizing approaches:
- Kelly‑inspired fraction tempered by drawdown tolerance.
- Tiered sizing by quality and uncertainty buckets (Core, Compounder, Special).

# Chapter 8: Industry Structure and Moat Analysis

Apply Five Forces with realism: consider dynamic entry/exit, switching costs, complements, and regulation. Combine with moat scoring across network effects, scale economies, brand, data, and regulatory capture.

Detect moat decay:
- Price wars and commoditization.
- Rising churn or declining switching costs.
- Talent drain and R&D inefficiency.
- Structural cost disadvantages emerging vs. peers.

# Chapter 9: Putting It Together — The Research Process

Adopt a consistent pipeline from idea to decision and time‑box each step.

Pipeline:
1) Screening and hypothesis: why could this be mispriced?  
2) Primary sources first: filings, transcripts, product demos, customer calls.  
3) Model what matters: a handful of drivers explain most of value.  
4) One‑page memo: thesis, risks, variants, valuation range, catalysts.  
5) Decision journal: record pre‑mortem; after outcomes, write post‑mortems.  

Artifacts:
- KPI dashboard updated quarterly.
- Business quality scorecard and risk register.
- Valuation workbook with conservative and upside cases.

# Chapter 10: Practical Valuation Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates a simplified, conservative process you can adapt to any company.

Steps:
1) Normalize revenue growth to a base‑rate range informed by industry data.  
2) Estimate steady‑state margins based on unit economics and peer medians.  
3) Compute owner earnings and build a 7‑year DCF with decaying growth.  
4) Cross‑check with residual income and the multiples triangle.  
5) Establish buy/uphold/trim price bands with explicit margin of safety.  

Interpret results by scenario weighting rather than a single point estimate.

# Chapter 11: Portfolio and Review Cadence

Cadence keeps theses fresh and prevents drift.

- Quarterly: update KPI dashboard, thesis‑critical metrics, and risk flags.
- Semi‑annual: re‑underwrite top positions from first principles.
- Traffic‑light system: Green (add), Amber (monitor), Red (exit or shrink).
- Annual: reflect on decision journal and base‑rate calibration.
