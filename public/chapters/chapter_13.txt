📘 Chapter 13 — Portfolio Construction & Asset Allocation: Balancing Risk and Reward
Building a portfolio is more than picking good stocks—it’s about balancing risk, return, and long-term objectives. Even the best companies can underperform if portfolio risk is mismanaged.
This chapter covers:
	•	Principles of portfolio construction
	•	Asset allocation strategies
	•	Diversification and risk management
	•	Sector and stock weighting
	•	Rebalancing and monitoring
	•	Practical checklist for investors

13.1 Principles of Portfolio Construction
	•	Risk vs. Return Trade-off
	•	High-return assets → higher risk
	•	Low-risk assets → lower return
	•	Align portfolio with risk tolerance and investment horizon
	•	Diversification
	•	Spread investments across stocks, sectors, and asset classes
	•	Reduces unsystematic (company-specific) risk
	•	Liquidity
	•	Ensure part of portfolio is easily convertible to cash
	•	Avoid over-allocating to illiquid investments
	•	Time Horizon
	•	Short-term → focus on stability and liquidity
	•	Long-term → focus on growth and compounding
	•	Alignment with Goals
	•	Income vs growth
	•	Retirement planning, emergency fund, or wealth creation

13.2 Asset Allocation Strategies
1. Strategic Asset Allocation
	•	Long-term, goal-oriented
	•	Example: 60% equities, 30% debt, 10% cash
	•	Reviewed periodically
2. Tactical Asset Allocation
	•	Adjusting asset weights based on short-term market outlook
	•	Example: Overweight FMCG during inflation, underweight cyclical stocks
3. Core-Satellite Approach
	•	Core → stable, blue-chip stocks and bonds
	•	Satellite → high-growth or sector bets to enhance returns
4. Lifecycle or Age-Based Allocation
	•	Younger investors → higher equity allocation
	•	Older investors → higher fixed-income allocation

13.3 Diversification
	•	Across Sectors: FMCG, IT, Pharma, Banking, Industrials
	•	Across Market Cap: Large-cap, Mid-cap, Small-cap
	•	Across Asset Classes: Equities, Debt, Gold, REITs, Cash
	•	Across Geographies: Domestic vs International exposure
Benefit: Reduces volatility while maintaining growth potential.

13.4 Stock & Sector Weighting
1. Position Sizing
	•	Limit exposure to individual stock → typically 5–10% per stock
	•	Avoid overconcentration in a single position
2. Sector Exposure
	•	Avoid >25–30% in one sector
	•	Consider cyclical vs defensive balance
3. Risk-Based Allocation
	•	Higher allocation to stable, low-beta stocks
	•	Moderate allocation to growth/high-beta stocks
	•	Small allocation to speculative or high-risk stocks

13.5 Risk Management in Portfolio
	•	Stop-loss & Exit Strategy
	•	Predetermine thresholds for each stock
	•	Avoid emotional decisions
	•	Hedging
	•	Use options, futures, or ETFs to reduce portfolio risk
	•	Regular Monitoring
	•	Track P/E, ROE, debt levels, and dividend trends of portfolio stocks
	•	Compare sector performance vs index
	•	Rebalancing
	•	Periodically adjust portfolio to restore target allocation
	•	Example: Equity allocation drifted to 70% → sell some to reduce risk

13.6 Performance Measurement
	•	Absolute Returns: Overall growth in portfolio value
	•	Relative Returns: Performance vs benchmark (e.g., Nifty 50, S&P 500)
	•	Risk-Adjusted Returns: Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Sortino ratio
Evaluate portfolio not just by returns, but returns per unit of risk.

13.7 Practical Checklist for Portfolio Construction
	•	Define financial goals and time horizon
	•	Determine risk tolerance
	•	Decide asset allocation (equity, debt, alternatives)
	•	Diversify across stocks, sectors, and geographies
	•	Limit position sizes and sector concentration
	•	Monitor company fundamentals regularly
	•	Track macro and industry trends for tactical adjustments
	•	Use risk metrics like beta, standard deviation, and FCF coverage
	•	Rebalance portfolio periodically
	•	Ensure margin of safety for each stock
Following this disciplined approach maximizes long-term wealth while minimizing risk exposure.
