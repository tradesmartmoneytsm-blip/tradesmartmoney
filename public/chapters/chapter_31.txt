📘 CHAPTER 34 — Building a Full Fundamental Analysis Model (Step-by-Step)
A complete valuation model integrates financial statements, ratios, forecasts, and intrinsic value calculations into one coherent structure. This is the chapter that ties everything together.

34.1 — What Is a Fundamental Analysis Model?
A fundamental analysis model is a structured framework to:
	•	Extract → raw financial data
	•	Transform → derive ratios, growth, margins
	•	Forecast → create future financials
	•	Value → calculate intrinsic value using DCF, multiples
	•	Interpret → evaluate management, industry, risks
	•	Decide → buy, hold, sell

34.2 — Structure of a Professional Valuation Model
A typical model includes:
1. Input Sheet
	•	Historical revenues, costs, profits
	•	Balance sheet items
	•	Cash flow items
	•	Macroeconomic inputs
	•	Assumptions (growth, inflation, risk-free rate)
2. Calculations Sheet
	•	Common-size statements
	•	Growth trends
	•	Ratio calculations
	•	Forecast formulas
	•	Capex & working capital projections
3. DCF Valuation Sheet
	•	FCFF or FCFE
	•	WACC
	•	Terminal value
	•	Intrinsic value
	•	Margin of safety
4. Comparable Valuation
	•	PE, PBV, EV/EBITDA
	•	Peer comparison
	•	Relative overvaluation/undervaluation
5. Output Summary Sheet
	•	Target price
	•	Bull/bear/base case
	•	Investment thesis
	•	Risks

34.3 — Creating Forecasted Financial Statements
Revenue Forecasting
Methods:
	•	Top-down (industry → company share)
	•	Bottom-up (units × price)
	•	Historical CAGR
	•	Regression with economic variables
	•	Segment-based forecasting
Expenses Forecasting
	•	Maintain historical margins
	•	Adjust for economies of scale
	•	R&D, marketing as % of revenue
	•	Salary inflation
Profit Forecast
	•	EBITDA = Revenue – Operating Costs
	•	EBIT = EBITDA – Depreciation
	•	Net profit = EBIT – Interest – Taxes
Free Cash Flow Forecast
	•	FCFF = EBIT(1-T) + Dep – Capex – ΔWorking Capital

34.4 — Integrating Risks Into the Model
Add explicit risk adjustments:
	•	Increase discount rate for high-risk firms
	•	Lower terminal growth
	•	Add “haircuts” to cash flow projections
	•	Create Bear, Base, Bull scenarios

34.5 — Investment Decision Framework
A professional framework:
Parameter
Weight
Business Quality
25%
Management Quality
15%
Financial Strength
20%
Growth Prospects
20%
Valuation (DCF + Comparables)
20%
Final decision based on weighted scoring.

📘 CHAPTER 35 — Integrating Technicals and Fundamentals
Modern investors combine both.

35.1 — Why Combine?
Fundamentals → What to buy Technicals → When to buy

35.2 — Technical Confirmation for Investors
Technicals used by fundamental investors:
	•	Trend analysis (50/200 DMA)
	•	Momentum (RSI, MACD)
	•	Volume confirmation
	•	Support levels for entry
	•	Supply-demand zones
Entry example:
	•	Fundamental value = ₹1500
	•	Market price = ₹1200
	•	Wait for breakout above ₹1180 with volume

35.3 — Avoiding Value Traps Using Technicals
A stock may appear cheap because:
	•	Industry dying
	•	Structural decline
	•	Corporate governance issue
Technical red flags:
	•	Price below 200-DMA continuously
	•	Lower lows, lower highs
	•	Big volume breakdowns

35.4 — Blended Valuation
Combined score:
	•	70% fundamental
	•	30% technical
This improves timing and reduces risk.
