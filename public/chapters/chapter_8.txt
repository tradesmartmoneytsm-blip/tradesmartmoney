📘 Chapter 8 — Growth Analysis: Revenue, Earnings, and Sustainable Growth
Growth is the lifeblood of long-term wealth creation in the stock market. Companies that compound revenue and earnings consistently outperform their peers, while businesses with erratic growth often disappoint investors.
In this chapter, we will learn:
	•	The types of growth that matter
	•	How to measure revenue and earnings growth
	•	Sustainable growth rate (SGR) and why it matters
	•	The difference between nominal and real growth
	•	How to detect high-quality vs. low-quality growth
	•	How growth patterns interact with valuation

8.1 Why Growth Matters
Investors often chase high growth stocks—but not all growth is created equal.
Good growth characteristics:
	•	Profitable (not just revenue growth)
	•	Generates cash
	•	Sustainable and repeatable
	•	Supported by competitive advantage (moat)
Bad growth characteristics:
	•	High debt-funded expansion
	•	Declining margins
	•	Negative free cash flow
	•	Driven by aggressive accounting
Growth without profitability is like a car without fuel—looks impressive but goes nowhere.

8.2 Types of Growth
1. Revenue Growth
Measures the top-line expansion of a company.
Formula:

High-quality revenue growth:
	•	Driven by core business, not one-time events
	•	Supported by volume increase, pricing power, or new products
	•	Across multiple geographies or segments (diversification)

2. Earnings Growth
Measures bottom-line expansion, i.e., how net profit grows over time.
Formula:

Important: Earnings must be compared with cash flow to ensure quality.

3. Free Cash Flow (FCF) Growth
FCF growth measures actual cash available after reinvestment.
Formula:

High-quality growth = revenue ↑, earnings ↑, FCF ↑, ROE & ROCE ↑

8.3 Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
CAGR is the most reliable metric for understanding long-term growth trends.
Formula:

Where:
	•	Ending Value = Revenue/Earnings at end of period
	•	Beginning Value = Revenue/Earnings at start of period
	•	n = Number of years
CAGR smooths volatility and shows the true average growth rate over time.

8.4 Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR)
SGR tells us how fast a company can grow without external financing.
Formula:

	•	ROE = Return on Equity
	•	Dividend Payout = % of profit paid as dividends
Interpretation:
	•	Growth > SGR → may need debt or equity dilution
	•	Growth ≤ SGR → self-sustaining growth
	•	High SGR + high ROE → ideal combination
Companies with high ROE but low SGR often pay out most profits, limiting expansion.

8.5 Measuring Growth Quality
Not all growth is created equal. Key metrics to analyze quality:
	•	Revenue vs Earnings vs Cash Flow:
	•	Profit & FCF must grow along with revenue.
	•	Margin Stability:
	•	Rising revenue with falling margins → efficiency problem.
	•	Debt Impact:
	•	Growth funded by excessive debt → risky
	•	Repeatable Drivers:
	•	One-time contracts, tax benefits, or asset sales are not real growth.
	•	Industry Comparison:
	•	Growth must outperform peers consistently.

8.6 Growth Patterns Over Time
1. Steady Growth
	•	Revenue and earnings rise smoothly
	•	Margins stable
	•	Cash flow consistent
2. Cyclical Growth
	•	Linked to industry cycles (e.g., commodities, automobiles)
	•	Peak profits in booms, losses in downturns
3. Aggressive / Debt-Fueled Growth
	•	Rapid expansion with high leverage
	•	Risky if margins or cash flow fail
4. Organic vs Inorganic Growth
	•	Organic: new customers, products, efficiency
	•	Inorganic: acquisitions, mergers
	•	Investors prefer organic growth as it’s more predictable and durable

8.7 Industry and Business Model Growth Benchmarks
Industry
Typical Revenue CAGR
Margin Trend
Cash Flow Characteristics
FMCG
10–15%
Stable, high
Moderate, consistent FCF
IT Services
15–25%
Moderate, stable
High FCF
Pharma
10–20%
High, fluctuating
R&D-heavy, capex moderate
Manufacturing
5–15%
Moderate
Capex-heavy, FCF volatile
Tech / SaaS
20–40%
Low initially, improves
FCF may be negative early
Always compare a company to its industry peers, not absolute numbers.

8.8 Red Flags in Growth Analysis
	•	Revenue ↑ but FCF ↓ → low-quality growth
	•	Earnings ↑ but CFO stagnant → working capital manipulation
	•	Margins ↓ → pricing pressure or cost issues
	•	High leverage to fund growth → financial risk
	•	Acquisitions funded by debt → integration risk

8.9 How to Combine Growth with Valuation
High growth alone is not enough; valuation matters.
	•	P/E / PEG: Compare growth-adjusted valuation
	•	P/FCF: See if cash flow supports price
	•	ROE & ROCE: Ensure returns justify growth
	•	Debt-to-equity: Check sustainability
Investing in high-quality growth at reasonable prices = key to compounding wealth.

8.10 Growth Checklist for Investors
	•	CAGR of Revenue ≥ 5-year industry average
	•	CAGR of EPS aligns with revenue CAGR
	•	Free Cash Flow growing alongside earnings
	•	ROE & ROCE stable or rising
	•	Debt manageable, ICR comfortable
	•	Margins stable or improving
	•	Sustainable growth rate ≥ CAGR
	•	Growth drivers durable (brand, scale, moat)
	•	Peer benchmarking confirms superior performance
Meeting all criteria = strong indication of high-quality, sustainable growth.
