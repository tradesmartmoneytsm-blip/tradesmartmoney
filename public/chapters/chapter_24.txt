📘 Chapter 24 — Macroeconomic Analysis: Impact on Investments
Macroeconomic conditions shape the performance of companies, sectors, and markets. Investors who understand economic indicators can anticipate trends, manage risk, and align their strategies.
This chapter covers:
	•	Importance of macroeconomic analysis
	•	Key macroeconomic indicators
	•	Impact on markets and sectors
	•	Strategies to incorporate macro analysis
	•	Practical checklist for investors

24.1 Why Macroeconomic Analysis Matters
	•	Determines overall market direction
	•	Influences corporate earnings, valuations, and investor sentiment
	•	Helps align sector allocation and risk management
	•	Provides early signals for recession, inflation, or growth periods
Key Insight: Ignoring macroeconomic factors increases exposure to systemic risks, even in fundamentally strong companies.

24.2 Key Macroeconomic Indicators
	•	Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
	•	Measures economic growth
	•	Rising GDP → strong corporate earnings potential
	•	Declining GDP → risk of recession, weaker demand
	•	Inflation
	•	Price increase in goods/services
	•	Moderate inflation → signals economic growth
	•	High inflation → erodes margins, reduces purchasing power
	•	Interest Rates
	•	Set by central banks
	•	Higher rates → borrowing costs rise, lower valuations
	•	Lower rates → encourage investment, boost asset prices
	•	Unemployment Rate
	•	Indicates consumer demand and economic activity
	•	High unemployment → lower consumption, revenue pressure
	•	Fiscal Policy
	•	Government spending and taxation impact sectors differently
	•	Infrastructure, defense, or stimulus packages create sectoral opportunities
	•	Monetary Policy
	•	Liquidity, credit availability, and interest rate changes
	•	Impacts growth, inflation, and market sentiment
	•	Currency Exchange Rates
	•	Affects exporters, importers, and multinational companies
	•	Currency depreciation → boosts exports but increases import costs
	•	Global Economic Trends
	•	Trade policies, commodity prices, geopolitical events
	•	Emerging markets, commodity-dependent sectors, and global supply chains are impacted
