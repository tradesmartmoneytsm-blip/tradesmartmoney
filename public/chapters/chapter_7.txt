Chapter 7 — Financial Ratio Analysis: The Investor’s Microscope
Financial ratios are the lens through which an investor can examine a company’s performance. They help answer questions like:
	•	Is the company profitable?
	•	How efficiently is it using assets?
	•	How strong is its balance sheet?
	•	How risky is it financially?
	•	How does it compare to peers?
Without ratios, financial statements are just numbers. Ratios turn numbers into insights.

7.1 Why Ratios Matter
Ratios allow investors to:
	•	Compare companies across industries and sizes
	•	Track trends over time
	•	Detect hidden weaknesses
	•	Understand capital allocation quality
	•	Identify the best-performing companies with moat-like characteristics
Important: Ratios must be interpreted in industry context and historical trends.

7.2 The Five Key Categories of Ratios
Financial ratios are broadly classified into five categories:
	•	Profitability Ratios — Is the company earning well?
	•	Liquidity Ratios — Can the company pay short-term obligations?
	•	Solvency / Leverage Ratios — Can the company sustain long-term debt?
	•	Efficiency / Activity Ratios — How well does the company use assets and working capital?
	•	Valuation Ratios — Is the stock fairly priced relative to earnings, book value, or cash flow?

7.3 Profitability Ratios
1. Return on Equity (ROE)
Formula:

Interpretation:
	•	High ROE → strong profit generation from shareholders’ money
	•	Low ROE → poor capital utilization
Professional tip:
	•	Compare ROE to industry average and cost of equity
	•	Watch for ROE inflated by high debt

2. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
Formula:

Interpretation:
	•	Measures efficiency of capital (debt + equity)
	•	ROCE > 15–20% over years → strong business

3. Net Profit Margin (NPM)
Formula:

Insight:
	•	High margin → pricing power
	•	Rising margin → efficiency or moat
	•	Falling margin → competition, cost pressure

4. Gross Profit Margin (GPM)
Formula:

Insight:
	•	Shows operational efficiency
	•	Useful for FMCG, manufacturing, retail

7.4 Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios tell you whether the company can meet short-term obligations.
1. Current Ratio
Formula:

Interpretation:
	•	1.5–2 → healthy
	•	<1 → cash crunch risk
	•	3 → inefficient use of cash

2. Quick Ratio (Acid Test)
Formula:

Insight:
	•	Measures immediate liquidity without inventory

7.5 Solvency / Leverage Ratios
These ratios show long-term financial risk.
1. Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)
Formula:

Interpretation:
	•	Low D/E → low risk, self-funded
	•	Moderate D/E → balance between growth & risk
	•	High D/E → financial risk, interest burden

2. Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR)
Formula:

Interpretation:
	•	ICR > 3 → comfortable
	•	ICR < 2 → potential financial stress

7.6 Efficiency / Activity Ratios
Efficiency ratios reveal how well a company uses its resources.
1. Asset Turnover Ratio
Formula:

	•	High → efficient asset use
	•	Low → underutilized assets

2. Inventory Turnover
Formula:

	•	High → fast-moving products
	•	Low → slow-moving inventory, possible obsolescence

3. Debtor Days / Receivable Turnover
Formula:

	•	Rising → slow collection, possible credit issues
	•	Falling → efficient cash collection

4. Payable Days
Formula:

	•	High → favorable supplier terms
	•	Very high → delayed payments might indicate liquidity stress

5. Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)
Formula:

	•	Low / Negative CCC → highly efficient cash flow
	•	High CCC → cash tied up in operations

7.7 Valuation Ratios
Valuation ratios help determine if the stock is fairly priced.
1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
Formula:

	•	Compare to industry P/E and historical P/E
	•	High P/E → growth premium or overvaluation
	•	Low P/E → value or undervaluation

2. Price-to-Book (P/B)
Formula:

	•	Useful for asset-heavy businesses
	•	P/B > 3 → brand, moat, intangibles
	•	P/B < 1 → undervalued or distressed

3. PEG Ratio (P/E-to-Growth)
Formula:

	•	PEG ≈ 1 → fair value
	•	PEG < 1 → undervalued
	•	PEG > 1 → overvalued

4. Dividend Yield & Payout Ratios
	•	Dividend yield = Dividend / Market Price
	•	Payout ratio = Dividend / Net Profit
Insight:
	•	High payout → mature company
	•	Low payout → growth-focused

7.8 Combining Ratios for Complete Picture
Individual ratios are useful, but combined they reveal the real story:
Scenario
Ratios
Interpretation
High ROE, High ROCE, High NPM
Strong business, profitable, moat likely

High D/E, Low ICR
Financial risk, leverage caution

Low CCC, High CFO
Excellent working capital management

High P/E, PEG < 1
Growth undervalued, check fundamentals

Falling ROE, rising debt
Warning: moat eroding, capital mismanagement


7.9 Benchmarking Ratios Against Peers
	•	Absolute numbers are less important than relative position vs competitors
	•	Historical trends matter more than a single-year snapshot
	•	Industry averages guide the analysis
Pro Tip: Always combine ratios from income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. This triangulation exposes hidden weaknesses and strengths.

7.10 Common Mistakes in Ratio Analysis
	•	Looking at one year in isolation
	•	Ignoring industry differences
	•	Blindly trusting reported numbers without cash flow check
	•	Ignoring working capital dynamics
	•	Misinterpreting high ROE due to high leverage

7.11 The Ultimate Ratio Checklist for Investors
	•	Profitability → ROE, ROCE, Margins
	•	Liquidity → Current ratio, Quick ratio
	•	Solvency → D/E, Interest coverage
	•	Efficiency → Asset turnover, Inventory & Receivable days, CCC
	•	Valuation → P/E, P/B, PEG, Dividend yield
	•	Trend analysis → At least 5–10 years history
	•	Peer benchmarking → Industry comparison
Mastering ratio analysis = the ability to filter great businesses from mediocre ones quickly and reliably.
