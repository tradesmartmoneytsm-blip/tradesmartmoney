Stability & Track Record
Years of uninterrupted dividend payment
Guidelines:

	•	Check cash flow coverage to avoid dividend cuts

19.4 Dividend Growth Investing

	•	Reduced Risk
	•	Stable dividend-paying companies tend to be financially resilient
Example:
	•	₹100 invested in a stock with 4% yield and 8% dividend growth → value grows faster than simple 4% yield over decades
