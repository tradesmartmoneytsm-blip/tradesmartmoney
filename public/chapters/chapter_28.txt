📘 Chapter 28 — Valuation Techniques: Comparing Stocks Effectively
Valuation is the cornerstone of fundamental analysis. It helps investors determine if a stock is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly priced. Understanding various valuation methods enables better decision-making and portfolio allocation.
This chapter covers:
	•	Importance of valuation
	•	Common valuation techniques
	•	Advanced valuation models
	•	Sector-specific valuation considerations
	•	Practical checklist for investors

28.1 Why Valuation Matters
	•	Determines intrinsic value of a stock relative to its market price
	•	Helps avoid overpaying for growth or underestimating quality
	•	Guides portfolio allocation between value and growth stocks
	•	Enables comparison across companies in the same sector
Key Insight: Valuation ensures disciplined investing and long-term wealth creation.

28.2 Common Valuation Techniques
1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
	•	Formula:

	•	Measures how much investors pay for each rupee of earnings
	•	Compare with industry P/E, historical P/E, and growth expectations
Pros: Simple, widely used Cons: Not reliable for companies with negative earnings

2. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
	•	Formula:

	•	Measures price relative to net asset value
	•	Useful for asset-heavy companies (banks, manufacturing)
Pros: Indicates margin of safety Cons: Less meaningful for intangible-heavy businesses

3. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio
	•	Formula:

	•	Compares market value with revenue generation
	•	Useful for early-stage or high-growth companies

4. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
	•	Formula:

	•	Best for dividend-paying, stable companies
	•	Focuses on present value of future dividends

28.3 Advanced Valuation Models
1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
	•	Formula:

	•	Focuses on intrinsic value based on future cash flows
	•	Requires assumptions for growth rate, WACC, and terminal value
2. Enterprise Value Multiples
	•	EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales
	•	Useful for comparing firms with different capital structures
	•	Reflects total firm value relative to earnings

28.4 Sector-Specific Valuation Considerations
	•	Tech Companies: High growth, use P/E, PEG, DCF
	•	Banks & Financials: Focus on P/B, ROE, and credit quality
	•	FMCG & Consumer Goods: P/E, dividend yield, and market share
	•	Energy & Commodities: EV/EBITDA, P/S, and commodity prices
Key Insight: Valuation must be contextual to sector characteristics and company fundamentals.

28.5 Practical Checklist for Valuation
	•	Determine appropriate valuation method based on sector and growth stage
	•	Compare ratios with industry peers and historical trends
	•	Evaluate growth assumptions in P/E, PEG, or DCF
	•	Consider balance sheet strength and debt levels
	•	Analyze dividend sustainability for DDM
	•	Adjust for one-time events or extraordinary items
	•	Check macro and sector trends influencing multiples
	•	Maintain margin of safety to account for uncertainty
	•	Use multiple valuation techniques for confirmation
	•	Make investment decisions based on intrinsic value vs market price
Valuation combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify opportunities and avoid overpaying, forming the foundation of intelligent investing.
