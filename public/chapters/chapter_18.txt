18.6 Combining Technicals with Fundamentals
	•	Use fundamentals to select quality stocks
	•	Use technicals to time entry and exit
	•	Avoid purely technical trading for long-term investing

	•	Use RSI and MACD for confirmation

18.7 Practical Checklist for Investors Using Technicals
	•	Identify the primary trend (up, down, sideways)
	•	Use multiple timeframe analysis (daily, weekly, monthly)
	•	Determine key support and resistance levels
	•	Analyze volume patterns to confirm trend strength
	•	Apply indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) for timing
	•	Combine with fundamental valuation metrics
	•	Set stop-loss and target levels before entry
	•	Review trades and adjust strategies based on performance
Technical analysis complements fundamentals by enhancing timing, risk management, and market awareness.
