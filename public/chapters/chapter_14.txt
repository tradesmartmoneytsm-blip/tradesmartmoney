📘 Chapter 14 — Financial Statement Analysis: Advanced Techniques for Investors
Financial statements are the backbone of fundamental analysis. Beyond basic ratios, advanced techniques allow investors to uncover hidden risks, assess quality of earnings, and evaluate cash flow health.
In this chapter, you will learn:
	•	Importance of financial statement analysis
	•	Key statements and their role
	•	Advanced ratio analysis
	•	Quality of earnings assessment
	•	Cash flow and working capital evaluation
	•	Red flags and forensic analysis
	•	Practical checklist for investors

14.1 Why Financial Statement Analysis Matters
	•	Provides a transparent view of a company’s financial health
	•	Helps differentiate real performance vs accounting gimmicks
	•	Essential for valuation, risk management, and decision making
Key Insight: A strong balance sheet and robust cash flows are better predictors of long-term success than reported profits alone.

14.2 Key Financial Statements
	•	Income Statement (Profit & Loss)
	•	Tracks revenue, expenses, and profitability
	•	Key focus: revenue growth, operating margins, net profit
	•	Balance Sheet
	•	Snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity
	•	Key focus: liquidity, leverage, capital structure
	•	Cash Flow Statement
	•	Tracks real cash movements: operations, investing, financing
	•	Key focus: free cash flow, dividend coverage, debt servicing
	•	Notes to Accounts
	•	Provides critical qualitative information on accounting policies, contingent liabilities, and related party transactions

14.4 Quality of Earnings Assessment
	•	High reported profits may not reflect real cash flow
	•	Techniques to assess quality:
	•	Cash vs Accounting Profit
	•	Compare Net Profit vs CFO
	•	Persistent gap → aggressive accounting
	•	Revenue Recognition Policies
	•	Early recognition inflates revenue
	•	Deferred revenue or long-term contracts may hide earnings
	•	Non-Recurring Items
	•	Extraordinary gains/losses, one-time adjustments
	•	Exclude when assessing sustainable earnings
	•	Margins Analysis
	•	Declining margins despite rising revenue → cost pressure or inefficiency

14.5 Cash Flow & Working Capital Analysis
	•	Free Cash Flow (FCF)

	•	Indicates cash available for dividends, debt repayment, and growth
	•	Cash Flow from Operations vs Net Profit
	•	CFO consistently > Net Profit → high-quality earnings
	•	Working Capital Metrics
	•	Inventory Days, Debtor Days, Payable Days, Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)
	•	Longer CCC → capital tied up, potential liquidity stress

14.6 Financial Forensics: Detecting Red Flags
	•	Unusually high revenue growth without cash flow increase
	•	Rising receivables or inventory relative to sales
	•	Frequent changes in accounting policies
	•	High related-party transactions or unusual off-balance sheet items
	•	Declining margins with stable or rising sales
	•	High debt levels with declining interest coverage
Detecting these early prevents capital loss and poor investment decisions.

14.7 Integrating Financial Analysis with Valuation
	•	Profitability + Cash Flow → supports DCF assumptions
	•	Leverage + Liquidity → adjusts risk premium in WACC
	•	Working Capital trends → assess sustainability of dividends and growth
	•	Red flags → may lower intrinsic value or increase margin of safety

14.8 Practical Checklist for Advanced Financial Analysis
	•	Review historical income statements for revenue and margin trends
	•	Check balance sheet stability – leverage, liquidity, equity growth
	•	Analyze CFO and FCF for quality of earnings
	•	Evaluate working capital efficiency – inventory, receivables, payables
	•	Examine non-recurring items and accounting policies
	•	Compare ratios against industry peers
	•	Look for red flags or unusual patterns
	•	Use findings to inform valuation and portfolio allocation
A disciplined, advanced financial analysis provides confidence in stock selection and risk management.
