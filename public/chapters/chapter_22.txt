📘 Chapter 22 — Portfolio Management: Constructing a Winning Portfolio
Investing in individual stocks is important, but how you combine them into a portfolio determines overall success. Portfolio management balances risk, return, and diversification to achieve long-term financial goals.
This chapter covers:
	•	Principles of portfolio management
	•	Asset allocation strategies
	•	Diversification techniques
	•	Risk and return assessment
	•	Monitoring and rebalancing
	•	Practical checklist for investors

22.1 What is Portfolio Management?
	•	The process of selecting and managing a combination of investments
	•	Goals:
	•	Maximize returns
	•	Minimize risk
	•	Align with investment horizon and financial objectives
Key Insight: A portfolio is more than the sum of individual stocks; correlation, risk, and diversification matter as much as stock selection.

22.2 Principles of Portfolio Management
	•	Diversification
	•	Spread investments across sectors, asset classes, and geographies
	•	Reduces unsystematic risk
	•	Asset Allocation
	•	Decide proportion of equity, debt, and alternative investments
	•	Based on risk tolerance and investment horizon
	•	Risk-Return Tradeoff
	•	Higher returns require higher risk
	•	Portfolio should match investor’s risk profile
	•	Regular Monitoring
	•	Track performance, market trends, and reallocate as needed
	•	Discipline and Patience
	•	Avoid emotional reactions to market fluctuations

22.3 Asset Allocation Strategies
	•	Strategic Asset Allocation
	•	Long-term target allocation based on goals and risk tolerance
	•	Example: 60% equity, 30% debt, 10% alternatives
	•	Tactical Asset Allocation
	•	Short-term adjustments based on market conditions or opportunities
	•	Dynamic Asset Allocation
	•	Gradual changes in allocation as age, risk tolerance, or market environment changes
	•	Core-Satellite Approach
	•	Core: Stable, low-risk investments
	•	Satellite: High-growth or high-potential opportunities

22.4 Diversification Techniques
	•	Sector Diversification: Avoid concentration in one sector
	•	Geographic Diversification: Spread across domestic and international markets
	•	Market Cap Diversification: Large-cap stability, mid-cap growth, small-cap potential
	•	Asset Class Diversification: Equities, debt, real estate, commodities, cash
Key Insight: Diversification mitigates risk but does not eliminate market-wide risk.

22.5 Risk and Return Assessment
	•	Expected Return
	•	Weighted average return of portfolio components
	•	Portfolio Risk
	•	Standard deviation or volatility of combined assets
	•	Correlation
	•	Low or negative correlation between assets reduces overall risk
	•	Sharpe Ratio
	•	Risk-adjusted return measure:

	•	Drawdown Analysis
	•	Measures potential losses from peak to trough

22.6 Monitoring and Rebalancing
	•	Periodic Review
	•	Check performance relative to goals and benchmarks
	•	Rebalancing
	•	Restore original target allocation
	•	Lock in gains and reduce overweighted assets
	•	Performance Attribution
	•	Analyze which stocks or sectors contributed to returns or losses
	•	Risk Management
	•	Adjust for changes in risk tolerance, market conditions, or personal circumstances

22.7 Practical Checklist for Portfolio Management
	•	Define investment objectives and horizon
	•	Assess risk tolerance
	•	Construct a diversified portfolio across sectors, geographies, and asset classes
	•	Determine strategic and tactical asset allocation
	•	Track portfolio performance and risk metrics regularly
	•	Rebalance portfolio periodically
	•	Monitor market trends, macroeconomic changes, and company fundamentals
	•	Avoid over-concentration in single stock or sector
	•	Maintain liquidity for opportunities or emergencies
	•	Review and adjust portfolio based on life changes or goals
Effective portfolio management balances risk, return, and discipline, providing the foundation for long-term wealth creation.
