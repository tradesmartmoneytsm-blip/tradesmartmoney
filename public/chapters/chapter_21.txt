21.5 Balancing Valuation and Growth
	•	Growth stocks often trade at premium valuations
	•	Focus on valuation vs expected growth:
Example: PEG Ratio
	•	PEG = P/E ÷ Earnings Growth Rate
	•	PEG < 1 → potentially undervalued

	•	Use technical trends to time entry/exit for high-growth stocks

21.7 Risks in Growth Investing
