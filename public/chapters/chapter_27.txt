📘 Chapter 27 — Technical Analysis: Complementing Fundamental Analysis
While fundamental analysis evaluates a company’s intrinsic value, technical analysis focuses on price movements and market trends. Combining both approaches helps investors time entries and exits, manage risk, and enhance returns.
This chapter covers:
	•	Principles of technical analysis
	•	Price patterns and trends
	•	Key indicators and oscillators
	•	Volume analysis
	•	Integrating technicals with fundamentals
	•	Practical checklist for investors

27.1 What is Technical Analysis?
	•	Analyzes historical price and volume data to forecast future movements
	•	Relies on charts, patterns, and indicators
	•	Belief: Market price reflects all available information, including fundamentals and sentiment
Key Insight: Technical analysis provides timing insights that complement fundamental valuation and long-term investing.

27.2 Core Principles of Technical Analysis
	•	Price Discounts Everything
	•	All information, news, and expectations are reflected in the price
	•	Prices Move in Trends
	•	Trends can be upward, downward, or sideways
	•	“The trend is your friend” until it reverses
	•	History Tends to Repeat
	•	Price movements are influenced by investor psychology
	•	Patterns often recur under similar market conditions

27.3 Price Patterns and Chart Types
Common Chart Types:
	•	Line Charts: Simplest view, connecting closing prices
	•	Bar Charts: Displays high, low, open, and close
	•	Candlestick Charts: Shows daily price action with body and wicks
Key Patterns:
	•	Trend Patterns: Uptrend, downtrend, sideways
	•	Reversal Patterns: Head & Shoulders, Double Top/Bottom
	•	Continuation Patterns: Flags, Pennants, Triangles
Interpretation: Patterns provide visual cues for potential price direction and entry/exit points.

27.4 Key Indicators and Oscillators
Trend Indicators:
	•	Moving Averages (SMA, EMA): Identify support/resistance and trend direction
	•	MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Signals trend changes
Momentum Indicators:
	•	RSI (Relative Strength Index): Identifies overbought or oversold conditions
	•	Stochastic Oscillator: Confirms potential reversals
Volume-Based Indicators:
	•	On-Balance Volume (OBV): Confirms trends via volume changes
	•	Volume Moving Average: Detects accumulation or distribution
Key Insight: Indicators are tools to support decisions, not guarantees of price movements.

27.5 Integrating Technicals with Fundamentals
	•	Fundamental analysis → identifies quality companies
	•	Technical analysis → optimizes timing for buying and selling
	•	Combined Approach:
	•	Select fundamentally strong stocks
	•	Use charts and indicators to identify entry points
	•	Confirm with volume and momentum signals
Example: A strong earnings growth company (fundamental) may see a breakout above resistance (technical) → good entry point.

27.6 Practical Checklist for Technical Analysis
	•	Select appropriate chart type (line, bar, candlestick)
	•	Identify trend direction (up, down, sideways)
	•	Spot key support and resistance levels
	•	Recognize patterns for reversals or continuation
	•	Use moving averages and MACD to confirm trends
	•	Check RSI and Stochastic for overbought/oversold signals
	•	Analyze volume trends to validate price moves
	•	Combine with fundamental insights before executing trades
	•	Implement stop-losses based on technical levels
	•	Maintain discipline and avoid emotional trading
Technical analysis complements fundamental analysis by enhancing timing, managing risk, and improving trade execution.
