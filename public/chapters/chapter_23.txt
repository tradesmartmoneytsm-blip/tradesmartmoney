This chapter covers:
	•	Importance of sector analysis
	•	Key macro and micro indicators
	•	Sector life cycle and trends
	•	Tools for evaluating industries
	•	Practical checklist for investors

23.1 Why Sector Analysis Matters
	•	Industries move in cycles; knowing the cycle helps in timing investments
	•	Sector trends influence profitability, valuation, and growth potential
	•	Helps in diversifying across sectors to reduce unsystematic risk
	•	Enables investors to identify emerging growth sectors or declining industries
Key Insight: Strong companies in weak sectors may struggle; conversely, growth in favorable sectors can boost returns.

23.2 Key Macro Indicators for Sector Analysis
	•	Economic Growth (GDP)
	•	Determines demand for products and services

	•	Tax, subsidies, and industry regulations influence profitability
	•	Examples: Renewable energy incentives, telecom spectrum auctions
	•	Global Trends
	•	Exports, trade policies, and currency fluctuations impact sector performance

23.3 Sector Life Cycle
	•	Emerging Sector
	•	High growth, high volatility, early-stage companies
	•	Example: Electric vehicles, cloud computing
	•	Growth Sector
	•	Companies expanding rapidly, improving margins
	•	Example: IT services, consumer electronics
	•	Mature Sector
	•	Stable revenue and profits, moderate growth
	•	Example: FMCG, utilities
	•	Declining Sector
	•	Saturated markets, shrinking demand
	•	Example: Traditional print media, older telecom technologies
Investment Strategy:

	•	Maintain core holdings in mature sectors for stability
	•	Avoid or exit declining sectors unless companies have strong moats

23.4 Micro Indicators for Industry Analysis
	•	Market Size & Growth Rate → potential revenue expansion
	•	Profit Margins & Cost Structure → sector profitability
	•	Competition & Market Share → concentration vs fragmentation
	•	Technological Disruption → risk or opportunity
	•	Consumer Behavior & Trends → demand shifts
	•	Regulatory Landscape → compliance costs and incentives

23.5 Tools for Sector Evaluation
	•	Financial Ratios Comparison
	•	Compare ROE, ROCE, OPM, P/E, and debt ratios across sector peers
	•	Industry Reports
	•	Government, consultancy, and market research publications
	•	Economic Calendars
	•	Track macro events impacting sectors
	•	SWOT Analysis for the Sector
	•	Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
	•	Charts & Technical Indicators
	•	Sector ETFs or indices help track performance trends

23.6 Practical Checklist for Sector Analysis
	•	Identify current macroeconomic phase and industry alignment
	•	Evaluate industry growth trends and market size
