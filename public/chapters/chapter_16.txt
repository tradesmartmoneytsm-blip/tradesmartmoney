	•	Common cognitive biases in investing
	•	Market sentiment and its effect on valuation
	•	Emotional traps and herd behavior
	•	Practical strategies to counter biases

16.1 Introduction to Behavioral Finance
	•	Traditional finance assumes rational investors
	•	Behavioral finance studies how emotions, biases, and heuristics affect investment decisions
	•	Understanding psychology can prevent costly mistakes and identify market opportunities
Key Insight: Markets are influenced as much by human behavior as by fundamentals.

16.2 Common Cognitive Biases in Investing
	•	Overconfidence Bias
	•	Investors overestimate their knowledge and predictive abilities
	•	Leads to excessive trading and risk-taking
	•	Confirmation Bias
	•	Focusing on information that confirms pre-existing beliefs
	•	Ignoring negative signals about a stock or industry
	•	Anchoring Bias
	•	Relying heavily on an initial reference point (e.g., previous stock price)
	•	May lead to poor entry or exit timing
	•	Recency Bias
	•	Giving undue weight to recent events
	•	Overreacting to short-term trends rather than long-term fundamentals
	•	Loss Aversion
	•	Pain from losses is psychologically stronger than pleasure from gains
	•	Can cause premature selling or avoiding potentially profitable investments

	•	Following market trends without independent analysis
	•	Can create bubbles and crashes

	•	Treating money differently based on source or context
	•	Leads to inconsistent risk-taking

16.3 Market Sentiment and Valuation
	•	Greed and fear drive short-term price swings
	•	Market sentiment can inflate or depress valuations temporarily
	•	Price may deviate from intrinsic value due to behavioral factors:
Market Phase
Investor Behavior
Effect on Valuation
Euphoria
Overconfidence, FOMO
Overvaluation
Panic
Fear, panic selling
Undervaluation
Recovery
Optimism returns
Gradual price normalization
Understanding sentiment allows investors to buy low during fear and sell high during greed.

	•	Maintain a long-term perspective
	•	Ignore short-term noise and focus on fundamentals
	•	Keep a journal
	•	Track decisions and biases influencing them
	•	Stress-test assumptions

	•	Avoid herd mentality
	•	Independently verify information and perform due diligence
	•	Predefine entry/exit points
	•	Helps avoid emotional decisions during market swings

16.6 Practical Checklist for Behavioral-Aware Investing
