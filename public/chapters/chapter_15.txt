📘 Chapter 15 — Advanced Valuation Techniques: Options, Scenarios & Sensitivity Analysis
Basic valuation methods provide a starting point, but advanced techniques help investors navigate uncertainty. This chapter focuses on enhancing valuation models using scenario analysis, sensitivity testing, and option-based approaches.
In this chapter, you will learn:
	•	Limitations of basic valuation
	•	Scenario analysis
	•	Sensitivity analysis
	•	Monte Carlo simulations
	•	Real options valuation
	•	Practical checklist for investors

15.1 Why Advanced Valuation Matters
	•	Business forecasts are uncertain; assumptions can vary widely
	•	Small changes in growth rate, WACC, or margins can drastically affect intrinsic value
	•	Advanced techniques allow investors to:
	•	Quantify potential outcomes
	•	Incorporate flexibility in business decisions
	•	Improve risk-adjusted investment choices
Key Insight: Understanding the range of possible valuations is more important than a single number.

15.2 Scenario Analysis
Definition: Evaluate valuation under different plausible future scenarios.
Steps:
	•	Define key variables: revenue growth, operating margins, CapEx, WACC
	•	Construct scenarios:
	•	Base Case → most likely assumptions
	•	Optimistic Case → aggressive growth and margin assumptions
	•	Pessimistic Case → conservative estimates or stress conditions
	•	Calculate intrinsic value for each scenario
	•	Assess probability-weighted value
Example:
Scenario
Revenue Growth
OPM
WACC
Intrinsic Value (₹)
Pessimistic
10%
18%
11%
450
Base Case
15%
22%
10%
520
Optimistic
20%
25%
9%
620
Scenario analysis shows the range of potential outcomes, not just a point estimate.

15.3 Sensitivity Analysis
Definition: Test how sensitive the valuation is to changes in key assumptions.
Steps:
	•	Identify critical variables: growth rate, discount rate, terminal value multiple
	•	Adjust each variable ±10–20% and recalculate intrinsic value
	•	Create a sensitivity table or tornado diagram
Example Table:
Variable
Low
Base
High
Revenue Growth
12%
15%
18%
WACC
9%
10%
11%
Terminal Growth

Intrinsic Value

Sensitivity analysis identifies which assumptions drive valuation the most.

15.4 Monte Carlo Simulation
	•	Uses randomized inputs within defined ranges
	•	Runs thousands of simulations to produce probability distribution of intrinsic value
	•	Provides probability-weighted insights and helps quantify risk
Steps:
	•	Define ranges and distributions for inputs (growth, margins, WACC)
	•	Generate random scenarios
	•	Calculate intrinsic value for each iteration
	•	Analyze the distribution, mean, median, and percentiles
Monte Carlo adds statistical rigor to valuation under uncertainty.

15.5 Real Options Valuation (ROV)
Definition: Evaluates flexibility embedded in business decisions (like expansion, delay, abandonment) as an option.
Examples:
	•	Option to expand → company can invest in high-growth market
	•	Option to delay → wait for market clarity before launching a product
	•	Option to abandon → exit an underperforming division
Steps:
	•	Identify the option embedded in business decisions
	•	Estimate potential cash flows if exercised
	•	Apply option pricing methods (e.g., Black-Scholes, binomial trees)
	•	Add option value to base DCF
Real options capture strategic flexibility often ignored in traditional DCF.

15.6 Practical Application for Investors
	•	Combine multiple techniques: DCF, scenario, sensitivity, Monte Carlo, real options
	•	Understand best-case, worst-case, and expected outcomes
	•	Incorporate flexibility and strategic options in valuation
	•	Use results to define margin of safety and risk limits

15.7 Common Pitfalls in Advanced Valuation
	•	Overconfidence in optimistic scenarios
	•	Ignoring probability weighting of outcomes
	•	Using unrealistic input ranges in Monte Carlo
	•	Focusing only on base-case DCF
	•	Treating option value as guaranteed cash flow
Avoiding these pitfalls ensures robust and realistic valuation.

15.8 Practical Checklist for Advanced Valuation
	•	Start with base-case DCF
	•	Perform scenario analysis (pessimistic, base, optimistic)
	•	Conduct sensitivity analysis on key assumptions
	•	Run Monte Carlo simulations if needed
	•	Identify real options and estimate their value
	•	Compare results with market prices and relative valuation metrics
	•	Determine margin of safety for investment decisions
	•	Monitor and update assumptions with new financial data
Advanced valuation transforms uncertainty into informed decision-making.
